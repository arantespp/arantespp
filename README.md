I like to think that this site [is my "digital garden", not a blog](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden). I use this term because I use it here to write about some thoughts and ideas I have and want to share with the world. And like a garden, a place where things grow, here is a site in which I "seed" my ideas little by little.

There are two kinds of posts here: [articles](https://github.com/arantespp/arantespp.com/tree/b6972d031c3b14786c74e4cbe8941b4cc5f36c0f/articles/README.md) and [Zettelkasten](https://github.com/arantespp/arantespp.com/tree/b6972d031c3b14786c74e4cbe8941b4cc5f36c0f/zettelkasten/README.md). [Articles](https://github.com/arantespp/arantespp.com/tree/b6972d031c3b14786c74e4cbe8941b4cc5f36c0f/articles/README.md) are texts that I put more creative efforts to write, I share some ideas, try to create some correlation among different topics. [Zettelkasten](https://github.com/arantespp/arantespp.com/tree/b6972d031c3b14786c74e4cbe8941b4cc5f36c0f/zettelkasten/README.md) is notes that I write when I doing some research. These notes don't bring anything new, it's just I piece of information about some topic. [Articles](https://github.com/arantespp/arantespp.com/tree/b6972d031c3b14786c74e4cbe8941b4cc5f36c0f/articles/README.md) use these notes to give more credibility to the posts.

The recommended posts aren't sorted by chronological order, but for a relevance rating I attribute to all posts.

This site is open source and you can find it on [GitHub](https://github.com/arantespp/arantespp.com).
