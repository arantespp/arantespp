I like to think that this site [is my "digital garden", not a blog](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden). I use this term because I use here to write about some thoughts and ideas I have and want to share with the world. And like a garden, a place where things grow, here is a site in which I "seed" my ideas little by little.

There are two kinds of posts here: [articles](/articles) and [Zettelkasten](/zettelkasten). [Articles](/articles) are texts that I put more creative efforts to write, I share some idea, try to create some correlation among different topics. [Zettelkasten](/zettelkasten) is notes that I write when I doing some research. These notes don't bring anything new, it's just I piece of information about some topic. [Articles](/articles) use these notes to give more credibility to the posts.

The recommended posts aren't sorted by chronological order, but for a relevance rating I attribute to all posts.

This site is open source and you can find it on [GitHub](https://github.com/arantespp/arantespp.com).
