I call this chapter as "The Dance Teacher" because I met one that literally changed my life, for better. I like this part of my life because it triggered a chain of life changes in all aspects: loving, professional, friendship, and myself.

It was the begging of 2014, I had 20 years old and I was going to my fourth year of electrical engineering degree. At that time, I had taken a lot extracurricular activities, like Kung Fu classes, being a member of [Warthog Robotics](https://www.facebook.com/WarthogRobotics/), and dance classes. Also, my grades were very good. Academically, I did a good job. I had a lot of friends, my social life was also good.

But one part of my life wasn't good, it was terrible - my loving life. I was very shy. I didn't have courage to talk to girls expressing my sexually desires. Even drunk. If I talked to them like friends, it was ok, but with sexual desires, I couldn't. I was paralyzed. At this time, during my whole 4 years in college, I had only one dating.

Now let's see how my dance teacher enters in the history. So I've decided to start Forró classes in May. One reason was because I enjoyed dancing and, the second reason, to become more comfortable with women. And here the teacher dance appears. Let's call her Miss A.

Forró classes were at Wednesday, 9:30 pm (I had a nostalgic feeling now), it was a good schedule for me that semester. Miss A. was a very beautiful, her smile was one of the most beautiful I had ever seen. She was very friendly. I was delighted. As the time passed by, we became good friends. We've talked to each other every day, we've gone the dancing events together, theater. And as you can imagine, I fell in love with her.

But there was a problem, and guess what? I didn't have courage to tell her. And worse, I've expected her to realized that I was fall in love with her and took action. However, at the end of October or beginning of November, she started to walk away from nowhere. She didn't text me anymore, didn't talk to me as before in the classes, we didn't hang out anymore.

That was terrible for me. I was really loving being with her. I thought she also was enjoying being with me, maybe she liked me as I did. I don't know if she got tired, if I didn't take any action, if she met someone else... I don't know because I didn't ask.

I've suffered for some time because I was in love. My heart was broken. But after consider what happened to me, the worse wasn't my broken heart, it was that I had no courage or initiative to tell her my feelings, neither a simple _"Miss A., I like you"_. The worse was expecting that she realizes and took some action for me. The worse was that I was not being the owner of my life and it was being ruled by others, not by me. I asked myself, "How long won't I live my life and I'll let others live it for me?" Believe in me, that question changed my life.

From the moment I realized that I needed to change to be in charge of my life, I start to live my life intensely and with joy. Not only my sexual and loving life improved, also my friendships, my professional, intellectual, and spiritual life. My interactions with my family became incredibly better. The next chapters I'm going to tell you how I became more vulnerable, more human..., more myself.
