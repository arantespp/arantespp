## What is The Feynman Technique?

I need to investigate more, but I have a feeling that your explanation of things we're learning follows a sine curve. When we know nothing or a little, we explain with simplicity because we don't know so much.

When we start understanding the subject, our brain is creating connections, but they're messy, we don't have enough effective connections. Every piece of information looks like independent but at the same time, may be connected to every other piece of knowledge. At this point, we can't explain in a concise way because we don't know how the pieces correlate to each other. It's like a thousand piece puzzle that we just opened and throw the pieces on the table. Trying to explain is like catching pieces randomically and trying to create a explanation of how these pieces fit together, even if they don't.

At the final stage, when we understand the whole subject, the connections in our brain are well defined and clear. When this happens, we are able to explain plainly. At this point, your puzzle is finished and every group of pieces we pick up, we can show (explain) clearly because they fit together and we don't have to create complexes explanations, it's straightforward.

The [Feynman Technique](/zettelkasten/the-feynman-technique) benefit is that it helps we assemble the puzzle in our head. When we force ourself to explain some topic to a child, we are forced to remove all complexities of our argument, we have to figure out how to create the best connections. We can choose the least amount information that don't increase the complexity but that gives the most important overview of that topic - Pareto Principle - we can explain using 20% of the pieces and they give to our listener 80% of the topic overview. We don't need to talk about the only blue pieces of our puzzles that represents the sky as they aggregate no relevance to the puzzle draw.

## What is Mental Models?

[Mental models](/zettelkasten/mental-models) are information templates that we can use to [understand situations](/zettelkasten/system-mental-models) in our lives or make [decisions](/zettelkasten/decision-mental-models). Sometimes, when we learn some topic, we attach that topic to a specific context. When we extract a mental models from the topic we're learning, we can use that template in others contexts.

For instance, when I first learned about [entropy](/zettelkasten/entropy) in high school, I highly attached it to thermodynamics and physics and I thought that it could be used in this context. However, if we transform entropy in a template, in a mental model, we may use in others contexts.

EXPLAIN WHAT IS ENTROPY IN THERMODYNAMICS

GIVE EXAMPLES OF HOW MIGHT WE USE ENTROPY PRINCIPLES TO EXPLAIN CODE TECHNICAL DEBT, BITCOIN OR A HOUSE THAT ARE NOT CLEANED.

In our analogy, using a knowledge in a specific context only is like we assemble the puzzle in a table and cannot move it from there. Transforming it in a mental model is like assembling it in a frame. We can use the frame in our living room, bedroom, or in another house.

## How Can We Use Both Together?

Since I've started blogging, I've been reading a lot of topics, from [psychology](/tags/psychology) to [database systems](/tags/database). But at the same time, I've always been thinking in how to improve the knowledge retention, how to retain the knowledge more efficiently.
