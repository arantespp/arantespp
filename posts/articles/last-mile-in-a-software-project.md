We built an App recently for a researchers team about helping other researchers to keep their projects in day. Let's call this project as **ProRes**. There was a problem with this project: we took so much time to finish it, and the quality wasn't the best as we were used to. I was wondering about this project and others we've built at [Triângulos Tecnologia](https://triangulostecnologia.com), I had some insights about the issues we had.

THe other projects aren't necessarily easier, they were as difficult as **ProRes**, but it took 4x more time. The biggest difference we the scope.

I think this problem is correlated to the last mile problem.

## Last Mile Problem

I first heard about [last mile problem when I was studying telecommunications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_mile). It occurs when we have a whole telecommunication infrastructure available except the one that links the final client, the final leg. For instance, suppose we have a optical fiber ring in a city that provides Internet to some buildings, but neighbor buildings don't have access to the ring. This is a last mile problem because the ring is working but some clients can't access.

We can see this problem in logistics too. A product may arrive in a capital of a country but might not arrives to neighbor cities because there isn't a easy path to there, for instance, need to cross a river.

_In summary, last mile problem is the last thing that need to be done to something works/arrives/finishes._

## Last Mile in a Software Development Context

Almost every App I build, I can see a last mile part in every feature I implement. The first part of a feature I create is the core. We can call core the most important and the essential functionalities that such feature must have. After the core implemented, we have what I call the final adjustments or the last mile. These adjustments doesn't change the functionalities, rather improve the user experience of the application. For instance, if we're building a form, the core features are the fields and the submit logic; the final adjustments are some input masks and design.

These final adjustments can have fewer tasks compared with the core, but it is the laborious part, then the time to finish it is almost as the core time implementation. We may explain this using the [flow state](/zettelkasten/flow-state-psychology). Core tasks commonly are more challenging and interesting to be done, a condition to enter the state, whilst the last mile tasks, don't.

## **ProRes** Execution

The **ProRes** App had some features. The objective of the project was validating these features, the prototype. Then, since the beginning, we started implementing all the core features together.
