Habits are the less spent energy strategy that we can use to achieve goals in your life.

Motivation are great at the beginning, but requires a tremendous amount of energy to keep you doing what you want to do. Motivation last for few days, but habits last forever.

Motivation is hard. We are lazy and we keep doing things that doesn't spend much energy. Technologies know this and automate everything to make us spend even less energy. Netflix, for instance, plays the next episode and we just need to keep our eyes open - we don't spend energy - and because of this, watching a Netflix series is very addictive. We must use technology in favor to make bad habits as difficult as possible and good ones easier. Access Instagram is very easy because you just need a single click in the App icon and you have all stories in front of your eyes. An strategy could be adding an App that makes you type a password every time you try to open Instagram, adding more energy and steps to perform the open Instagram app.
