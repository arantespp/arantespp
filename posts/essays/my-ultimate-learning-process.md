# My Ultimate Learning Process

I've always been fascinated by learning and learn faster, more efficient and with better quality. I don't remember the exact time, between 2011 and 2015, when I was in college, but trying to improve my learning process I started to practice fast reading. In fact, I was reading a lot more than before, more books, articles, newspapers among others with less time. I was happy, because I thought I was learning more, but I was wrong. Very wrong.

Fast reading is very good for skimming, but not for retention. Took some time to realize that I was fooling myself thinking I was learning more because after some days or hours, I couldn't remember what I've had reading before. Really!

The process is

- choose some subject I want very much to learn
- apply slow reading
- create some notes using Zettelkasten
- write these notes in public
- write an essay with this subject joining others notes from others subjects.

## 1. Choose some
