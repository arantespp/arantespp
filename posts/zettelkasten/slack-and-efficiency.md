## Notes

* Slack is the degree of freedom \(free time, for instance\) required to effect change.
  * If you have to do something new, you can only do it effectively if you have some degree of freedom.
  * If you don't have free time and must do something, you'll have to stop what you're doing, thus being ineffective because of [context switching](https://github.com/arantespp/arantespp.com/tree/b6972d031c3b14786c74e4cbe8941b4cc5f36c0f/zettelkasten/context-switching/README.md).
* _"Slack is the natural enemy of efficiency and efficiency is the natural enemy of slack."_ Defined by [Tom DeMarco](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0767907698).
  * Efficiency, in this case, means you have all resources allocated, for example, all people working 100% of their time.
  * If you want to keep everyone busy, you must allow some buffering.
* Slack can be perceived as negative in an environment of manic efficiency. It can be seen as laziness or lack of initiative.
* Slack can reduce efficiency, but it can increase effectiveness. If you have an excess of time, for instance, you have time to think about the long-term priorities and check if you're on the right trajectory instead of just doing operational tasks.
* It allows us to respond to changing circumstances and experiment more.
* Too much slack is bad because resources get wasted and people get bored.
  * But the absence of slack is a bigger problem than an excess of it.

## Questions

* Do lack of slack for a long period of time cause burnout?
