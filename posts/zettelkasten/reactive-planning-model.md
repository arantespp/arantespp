## Notes

* When a team starts a project without planning, the reactive planning model may ensue.
* [David Allen](https://github.com/arantespp/arantespp.com/tree/b6972d031c3b14786c74e4cbe8941b4cc5f36c0f/zettelkasten/david-allen/README.md) defined this planning in his book [Getting Things Done](https://github.com/arantespp/arantespp.com/tree/b6972d031c3b14786c74e4cbe8941b4cc5f36c0f/books/getting-things-done/README.md#chapter-3-getting-projects-creatively-under-way-the-five-phases-of-project-planning).
* It's a [system mental model](https://github.com/arantespp/arantespp.com/tree/b6972d031c3b14786c74e4cbe8941b4cc5f36c0f/zettelkasten/system-mental-models/README.md) because it helps you understand how a project's execution works without upfront planning.
* The phases of the reactive planning model are:
  1. Identifying next actions
  2. Organizing
  3. [Brainstorming](https://github.com/arantespp/arantespp.com/tree/b6972d031c3b14786c74e4cbe8941b4cc5f36c0f/zettelkasten/brainstorming/README.md)
  4. Outcome visioning
  5. Defining purpose and principles
* Such phases aren't the natural way your mind operates because you try to do actions before organizing, before collecting many ideas, before creating the vision before defining purposes.
* The team reacts to the situation instead of controlling it.
  * When stuff gets out of control, they **act**, word harder, get busier.
  * When having a lot of busy people, someone says, "We need to get **organized**!"
  * After some time, just organizing the problem isn't enough, and someone suggests, "Let's [**brainstorm**](https://github.com/arantespp/arantespp.com/tree/b6972d031c3b14786c74e4cbe8941b4cc5f36c0f/zettelkasten/brainstorming/README.md)!".
  * But the [brainstorming](https://github.com/arantespp/arantespp.com/tree/b6972d031c3b14786c74e4cbe8941b4cc5f36c0f/zettelkasten/brainstorming/README.md) isn't effective because they don't have a clear **vision**, **purpose**, and **principles**. Finally, they ask, "What are we trying to do here?" and start defining the last phase.
* The opposite of this model is the [natural planning model](https://github.com/arantespp/arantespp.com/tree/b6972d031c3b14786c74e4cbe8941b4cc5f36c0f/zettelkasten/natural-planning-model/README.md).

## Questions

* Which scenarios may we observe the reactive planning model?
