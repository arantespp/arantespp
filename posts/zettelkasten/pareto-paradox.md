## Notes

- Because of the [Pareto Principle](/zettelkasten/pareto-principle), we overmanage the 20% high payoff causes and undermanage the remaining 80%. This leads to what we might call **Pareto Paradox**.

- **Pareto Paradox** states that there is usuarlly more opportunities in the undermanaged 80% than the overmanaged 20%.
