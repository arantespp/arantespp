# What is Zettelkasten?

Zettelkasten is a method in which you write down your thoughts in notes, tag and connect them over time. I really appreciated this method and I use it when I'm studying some topic. I wrote [some notes](/zettelkasten/zettelkasten) here. If you want to know more about Zettelkasten, I recommend [this post](https://writingcooperative.com/zettelkasten-how-one-german-scholar-was-so-freakishly-productive-997e4e0ca125) that tell us a story about [Niklas Luhmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklas_Luhmann) work and how Zettelkasten helped him to be very productive.

My notes usually have 4 main parts:

- Notes: they're my notes about the topic.
- Questions: they're questions I made while studying the topic to perform a [metacognitive reading](/zettelkasten/reading-metacognitively).
- References: are references that I consulted to write the notes.
- Backlinks: links to other notes that made a reference to the current note.
