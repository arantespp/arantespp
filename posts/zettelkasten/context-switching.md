# context-switching

## Notes

* Context switching happens when you jump between tasks.
  * You're on call, but at the same time, you're working on a document.
  * You're watching a movie and checking your mobile.
  * You're writing an email and talking if your coworker.
* It kills productivity.
* It happens when you do [multitasking](https://github.com/arantespp/arantespp.com/tree/b6972d031c3b14786c74e4cbe8941b4cc5f36c0f/zettelkasten/human-multitasking/README.md).
* Each extra task or "context" you switch eats up 20-80% of your overall productivity.
