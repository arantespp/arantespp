## Notes

- This theory states that humans discount the value of a later reward, by the factor that increases with the length of the delay.

- It's mathematically described as:

$$
g(D) = \frac{1}{1 + kD}
$$

where $g(D)$ is the discount factor that multiples the reward's value, $D$ is the delay, and $k$ is the factor governing the degree of discounting.

- This is the reason that humans prefer short-term than long-term rewards.

- It reveals a tendency to make choices that are inconsistent over time.
  - We regret some decisions we made in the past, despite knowing the same information.
