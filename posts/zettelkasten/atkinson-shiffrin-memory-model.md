## Notes

* It's a model of memory proposed in 1968 by Richard Atkinson and Richard Shiffrin.
* It asserts that human memory has three separate components.
  1. A sensory register, where sensory information enters memory.
  2. A [short-term memory](https://github.com/arantespp/arantespp.com/tree/b6972d031c3b14786c74e4cbe8941b4cc5f36c0f/zettelkasten/short-term-memory/README.md), which receives and holds information from the sensory register and the [long-term memory](https://github.com/arantespp/arantespp.com/tree/b6972d031c3b14786c74e4cbe8941b4cc5f36c0f/zettelkasten/long-term-memory/README.md).
  3. A [long-term memory](https://github.com/arantespp/arantespp.com/tree/b6972d031c3b14786c74e4cbe8941b4cc5f36c0f/zettelkasten/long-term-memory/README.md), where information which has been rehearsed in the [short-term memory](https://github.com/arantespp/arantespp.com/tree/b6972d031c3b14786c74e4cbe8941b4cc5f36c0f/zettelkasten/short-term-memory/README.md) is held indefinitely.
