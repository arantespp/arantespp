## Notes

- It's a model of memory proposed in 1968 by Richard Atkinson and Richard Shiffrin.

- It asserts that human memory has three separate components.

  1.  A sensory register, where sensory information enters memory.
  1.  A [short-term memory](/zettelkasten/short-term-memory), which receives and holds information from the sensory register and the [long-term memory](/zettelkasten/long-term-memory).
  1.  A [long-term memory](/zettelkasten/long-term-memory), where information which has been rehearsed in the [short-term memory](/zettelkasten/short-term-memory) is held indefinitely.
