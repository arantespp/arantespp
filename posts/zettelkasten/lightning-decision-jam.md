# Lightning Decision Jam

## Notes

- Method to solve problems without discussion.
  - Replace all open and unstructured discussion with a clear solving problem process.
- Methods like brainstorm have discussions in which may cause problem like:
  - Discussions that loosing focus and don't solve the problem.
  - Very long talks that let the team very fatigued.
  - The one with the higher voice may impose his/her ideas.
  - People may sabotage each other to promote his/her "good" idea.
- Supplies (the colors can be changed):
  - Rectangular post-its (yellow).
  - 2 two different color post-its (blue and pink).
  - Voting dots, two different colors (red and green).
  - Sharpies.
  - A timer that clearly shows remaining time.
- Choose a moderator.
  - He/she can join in on the process but must focus on making sure no discussions breaks out.
  - Has to keep time.
- The method:

  1. Write the problems.
     - No discussion.
     - 7 minutes.
     - Everybody writes all the challenges, annoyances, mistakes, problems without discussion. Can be anything.
     - Write in blue squared post-its.
  2. Present the problems.
     - The moderator selects one person to present each his/her problems and stick them to the surface.
     - Nobody else in the team is allowed to speak.
     - Each person has 4 minutes.
  3. Select problems to solve.
     - 6 minutes.
     - The moderator gives two voting red dots to each member of the team.
     - They can vote on their own posts.
     - They can put two votes on the same post.
     - After voting, the moderator arrange the posts ir order of priority.
  4. Reframe/rewrite the problems as standardized challenges.
     - 6 minutes.
     - Reformat problems to standardized "How might we...".
     - Focus only on the prioritized problems (most voted).
     - Rewrite in a way that makes the problem solvable and standardized.
       - For instance, instead "I have to idea whats going on project X", rewrite as "How might we make sure everyone stays in the loop with all running projects".
  5. Produce solutions.
     - The top-left-most voted problem is chosen.
       - If there are two most voted problem just pick the most left one.
     - Each team member has 7 minutes to produce as much solutions as possible on pink squared posts-its.
     - No discussions.
     - **Aim quantity over quality.**
     - Stick the pink squared post-its on the surface.
  6. Vote on solutions.
     - 10 minutes.
     - The moderator gives six green voting dots to each team member.
     - Each member votes on the solutions they think would best solve the problem.
  7. Prioritize solutions
     - 30 seconds.
     - The team arrange the solutions list.
     - Ignore the solutions with the less than two votes.
  8. Decide what to execute on.
     - 10 minutes.
     - Put the solutions in a graphic Impact x Effort.
     - Choose the solution with higher impact and less effort, even if it isn't the most voted one.
  9. Turn solutions into actionable tasks.
     - 5 minutes.
     - The moderator takes the selected solution of previous step.
     - Each member writes actionable solutions on the rectangular yellow post-its.
       - Actionable means something that can be executed in a time frame (1 or 2 weeks).
  10. Execute the actionable tasks.

- What about that great idea that was not selected?
  - **Here good ideas does matter, executing and testing is what matters.**
