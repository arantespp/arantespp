## Notes

* Inflation is the rise of the general prices of an economy in a period caused by [money supply](https://github.com/arantespp/arantespp.com/tree/b6972d031c3b14786c74e4cbe8941b4cc5f36c0f/zettelkasten/money-supply/README.md) growth.
  * Note that the general prices may increase, but the cause may not be by [money supply](https://github.com/arantespp/arantespp.com/tree/b6972d031c3b14786c74e4cbe8941b4cc5f36c0f/zettelkasten/money-supply/README.md) growth, but for supply and demand changes, for example.
* If the inflation is positive, the general prices increases and each unit of the currency buy a few products and services.
* The opposite of inflation is deflation.
  * The general prices of products and services decrease.
* Long period of sustained inflation is correlated with [money supply](https://github.com/arantespp/arantespp.com/tree/b6972d031c3b14786c74e4cbe8941b4cc5f36c0f/zettelkasten/money-supply/README.md) growing rate higher than the economic growth rate.

## Questions

* What is better: high or low inflation?
* What are the second-order effects of high inflation? And a deflation?
* Why inflation increases when the [money supply](https://github.com/arantespp/arantespp.com/tree/b6972d031c3b14786c74e4cbe8941b4cc5f36c0f/zettelkasten/money-supply/README.md) growing rate is higher than the economic growth rate?
