# AIDA Model

## Notes

- It was created to understand better the process, or steps that the consumer goes thought, before purchasing a product.
- It was developed by E. St. Elmo Lewis, in 1898.
- AIDA stands for: **Attention**, **Interest**, **Desire** and **Action**.
  - **Attention**: attract the consumer attention via advertising materials. _Example: consumer watches a YouTube ad._
  - **Interest**: the interest in the product should be aroused in the consumer. _Example: more information about the product is presented to consumer in a website._
  - **Desire**: the seller should create a desire in the consumer to own the product. _Example: the seller provides examples and benefits that the product will brings to consumer._
  - **Action**: the consumer must take an action, whether buying or not. _Example: In the case of a e-commerce, this is the shopping cart process, that must be easiest as possible._
- Nowadays this model is not complete because:
  - It doesn't consider the emotion associated to a selling process, which is considered as elementary.
  - Targeting a social-demographic types of users isn't included.
  - The process doesn't need to be linear as proposed by this method.
