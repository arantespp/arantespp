## Notes

* It was created to understand better the process, or steps that the consumer goes through, before purchasing a product.
* It was developed by E. St. Elmo Lewis, in 1898.
* AIDA stands for: **Attention**, **Interest**, **Desire** and **Action**.
  * **Attention**: attract consumer attention via advertising materials. _Example: consumer watches a YouTube ad._
  * **Interest**: the interest in the product should be aroused in the consumer. _Example: more information about the product is presented to the consumer on a website._
  * **Desire**: the seller should create a desire in the consumer to own the product. _Example: the seller provides examples and benefits that the product will bring to the consumer._
  * **Action**: the consumer must take an action, whether buying or not. _Example: In the case of e-commerce, this is the shopping cart process, that must be easiest as possible._
* Nowadays this model is not complete because:
  * It doesn't consider the emotion associated with a selling process, which is considered elementary.
  * Targeting social-demographic types of users isn't included.
  * The process doesn't need to be linear as proposed by this method.
