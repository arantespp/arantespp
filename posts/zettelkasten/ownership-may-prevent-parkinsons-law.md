## Notes

* If you have $X$ time to complete some tasks and don't have enough motivation, why should you finish them in less time?
  * [Parkinson's Law](https://github.com/arantespp/arantespp.com/tree/b6972d031c3b14786c74e4cbe8941b4cc5f36c0f/zettelkasten/parkinsons-law/README.md) acts in this scenario.
* A sense of ownership may be a driver of motivation and may block the effects of [Parkinson's Law](https://github.com/arantespp/arantespp.com/tree/b6972d031c3b14786c74e4cbe8941b4cc5f36c0f/zettelkasten/parkinsons-law/README.md).
  * An [Atlassian research shows](https://www.atlassian.com/practices/open/research) that teams who have a clear vision of the bigger picture are more effective.
* If you know that your customer needs some feature with urgency \(ownership\), you may spend $t &lt; X$ time to finish that feature.
* How to create ownership?
  * Shift from a project mindset to a product mindset.
  * Delegate decisions to the lowest level possible.
  * Share information openly.
  * Invest in customer empathy.
