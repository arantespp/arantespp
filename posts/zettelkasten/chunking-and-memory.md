## Notes

* Chunking is a memorization method in which you group pieces of information in groups.
* This technique helps you memorize better because our [short-term memory](https://github.com/arantespp/arantespp.com/tree/b6972d031c3b14786c74e4cbe8941b4cc5f36c0f/zettelkasten/short-term-memory/README.md) cannot retain a lot of information at the same time.
  * When we group, we can retain the groups instead of each piece of information.
* Also, chunking improves our creativity because we need to create a meaningful connection among groups.
