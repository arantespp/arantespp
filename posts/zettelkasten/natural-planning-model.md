# natural-planning-model

## Notes

* It's the more effective way to think about projects and situations because it makes things happen sooner, better, and more successfully.
* Your brain needs a complex series of steps to occur before it can make anything happen physically.
* The phases of the natural planning model that your mind goes through to accomplish virtually any task \(opposite of the [reactive planning model](https://github.com/arantespp/arantespp.com/tree/b6972d031c3b14786c74e4cbe8941b4cc5f36c0f/zettelkasten/reactive-planning-model/README.md)\):
  1. Defining purpose and principles
  2. Outcome visioning
  3. [Brainstorming](https://github.com/arantespp/arantespp.com/tree/b6972d031c3b14786c74e4cbe8941b4cc5f36c0f/zettelkasten/brainstorming/README.md)
  4. Organizing
  5. Identifying next actions
* It's not necessarily normal. People often don't plan this much and end applying the opposite, the [reactive planning model](https://github.com/arantespp/arantespp.com/tree/b6972d031c3b14786c74e4cbe8941b4cc5f36c0f/zettelkasten/reactive-planning-model/README.md).
* It's a [system mental model](https://github.com/arantespp/arantespp.com/tree/b6972d031c3b14786c74e4cbe8941b4cc5f36c0f/zettelkasten/system-mental-models/README.md) because it helps you understand how your brain works when planning something.
* It's a [decision mental model](https://github.com/arantespp/arantespp.com/tree/b6972d031c3b14786c74e4cbe8941b4cc5f36c0f/zettelkasten/decision-mental-models/README.md) because it helps you decide how to plan something you want to accomplish.
