# the-four-criteria-model-for-choosing-actions-in-the-moment

## Notes

* It helps you decide which action you take in the present moment.
  * It's a [decision mental model](https://github.com/arantespp/arantespp.com/tree/b6972d031c3b14786c74e4cbe8941b4cc5f36c0f/zettelkasten/decision-mental-models/README.md).
* How to choose between studying about [mental models](https://github.com/arantespp/arantespp.com/tree/b6972d031c3b14786c74e4cbe8941b4cc5f36c0f/zettelkasten/mental-models/README.md), planning an application, or sending a WhatsApp message to your crush?
* It was taken from the book [Getting Things Done](https://github.com/arantespp/arantespp.com/tree/b6972d031c3b14786c74e4cbe8941b4cc5f36c0f/books/getting-things-done/README.md), by [David Allen](https://github.com/arantespp/arantespp.com/tree/b6972d031c3b14786c74e4cbe8941b4cc5f36c0f/zettelkasten/david-allen/README.md).
* The Four Criteria are:
  * **Context**: you're constrained by your environment. Which actions can be done at the place you are? You cannot code with you don't have a computer or anything to write code.
  * **Time Available**: how much time do you have until your next action. If you have a meeting in 10 minutes, you can't start an action that requires more time.
  * **Energy Available**: how much energy do you have? Some actions require physical and/or mental energy. You can't clean the house if you're very tired. You can't study mental models if you're sleepy.
  * **Priority Given**: given the context, time, and energy available, what remaining actions will give you the highest payoff? Here you need to rely on your intuition and judgment call in the moment.
