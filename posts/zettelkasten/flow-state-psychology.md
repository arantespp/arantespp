## Notes

* Is a mental state in which a person is performing an activity:
  * fully immersed;
  * high focus;
  * full involvement and enjoyment.
* It's the most efficient state when doing a task.
* Lose awareness of all other things.
* The person may lose the sense of time.
* Named by [Mihály Csíkszentmihályi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mihaly_Csikszentmihalyi) in 1975.
* Three conditions have to be met to achieve a flow state:
  1. Clear goals and progress.
  2. Clear and immediate feedback.
  3. The task difficult must match the person's skill level.
     * If task difficult &lt; person skill: boredom.
     * If task difficult = person skill: **flow**.
     * If task difficult &gt; person skill: anxiety.
* According to [Mihály Csíkszentmihályi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mihaly_Csikszentmihalyi), we can process about 110 bits of information per second.
  * Person in flow state decided to use all these bits on the task.
  * There is no more attention to be allocated.
