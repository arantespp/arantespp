## Notes

- It's is a lightweight [agile](/zettelkasten/agile) framework.

- It helps teams and organizations generate the highest possible value for the project.

- Is describes a set of meetings/events/ceremonies, tools/artifacts and roles to help teams structure and manage their work.

- Scrum Team:

  - Few people.
  - There are no sub-teams or hierarchies.
  - Every member must be focused on one objective at a time.
  - Roles:
    - Product Owner (PO):
      - Isn't always the product manager.
      - Ensure the developer team delivers the most value to the business on each sprint.
      - A person that represents the business and stakeholders.
      - Create and manage the product backlog.
      - Give the team clear guidance on which features to deliver next.
      - Decide when to ship de product.
      - Is individual.
    - Scrum Master (SM):
      - A team guide.
      - Knows the Scrum very well and coaches the whole team on the Scrum process.
      - Looks for ways to fine-tune the team Scrum process.
      - Is a facilitator, as he/she schedules the needed resources (human and logistical) for the events/ceremonies.
      - Helps the team optimize their communication, transparency and delivery flow.
    - Developers.

- Tools, or artifacts:

  - Product backlog:
    - The main list of work that needs to get done.
    - Maintained by the PO.
    - It's used as sprints input.
    - It's the "To Do" list.
    - It's constantly revisited, re-prioritized and maintained by the PO as the product priorities and the market changes.
  - Sprint Backlog:
    - Items selected from product backlog to be executed on the current sprint.
    - The "Doing" list.
  - Increment:
    - The result of a sprint.
    - The "Done" list.
    - Must add value to the project.

- Ceremonies, or events:

  1. Organize the backlog:
     - PO's responsibility.
     - Prioritize items as he/she knows more about the business, the market and the stakeholders priorities.
  2. Sprint planning:
     - The work to be performed during the current sprint.
     - Is planned by the entire team.
     - SM leads this event.
     - At the end of this meeting, every team member needs to be clear about the sprint goals, what can be delivered and how the increment can be delivered.
  3. Sprint:

     - The period that the Scrum team works to finish the increments.
     - Generally two weeks.
     - The more unknown and complex the work, the shorter the sprint should be.
     - All events happen during the sprint.

  4. Daily Scrum:

     - Daily super-short meetings that happens at the same time and place.
     - The goal is for everyone on the team to be on the same page, aligned with the sprint goal.
     - Each member team answer these questions:
       - What did I do yesterday?
       - What do I plan to do today?
       - Are there any obstacles?

  5. Sprint Review:

     - Happens at the end of the sprint.
     - The team gets together to present or inspect the increment.
     - The PO decides to release or not the increment.
     - The PO reworks the product backlog that will be used to feed the next sprint.

  6. Sprint retrospective:
     - The team comes together to document and discuss what worked and what didn't work in the current sprint.
       - The team can focus on what went well and what needs to be improved fot the next time.
