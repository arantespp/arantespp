## Notes

- It's a method that you can use the learn about anything.
- It makes you reading in a [metacognitively](/zettelkasten/reading-metacognitively) way.
- It has 4 steps:
  1. Choose the subject you want to learn.
  2. Try to explain what you know to a 12 years old child.
  3. Identify gaps in your explanation. If you're struggling to explain clearly, go back to the material.
  4. Review and simplify.
- You're understanding something, not only learning the names of something.
