# reading-metacognitively

## Notes

* You read actively, not passively.
* You constantly ask questions to yourself about what you're reading.
  * "Can I explain it to a 12 years old child?"
  * "Can I associate this with some other subject?"
  * "How can this can be applied to my life?"
* You try every time to make connections with another subject.
* Slows down your speed reading because you need more time to engage with the material.
* You expand your knowledge base because you send more information to your [long-term memory](https://github.com/arantespp/arantespp.com/tree/b6972d031c3b14786c74e4cbe8941b4cc5f36c0f/zettelkasten/long-term-memory/README.md).

## Questions

* How can I know that I'm reading/studying metacognitively?
* Which other areas besides reading can I perform metacognitively?
