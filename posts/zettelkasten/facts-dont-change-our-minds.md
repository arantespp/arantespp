## Notes

* We believe in things because i\) they're correct or ii\) we belong to a group.
  * Even if the facts are genuine, we may believe in something because we want to be a part of a group.
  * Being part of a group is wired in our brain because of our evolutionary history. Not belonging to any tribe was a death sentence.
    * Nowadays, we probably won't die, but we have a fear of being socially rejected.
* It's hard to change someone's mind because we're telling him/her leaves some group, which causes fear of being alone about the new fact.
  * A way to change someone's mind is to create a connection first, show to him/her that he/she will be a part of a tribe and won't be alone.
