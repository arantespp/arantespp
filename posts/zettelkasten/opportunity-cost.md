## Notes

* Opportunity cost is the loss of the benefit of the best foregone option that you could have chosen.
  * You have choices A, B, and C with $B\_a = 100$, $B\_b = 80$, and $B\_c = 50$ as their respective benefit. Considering you've chosen the best option, A, your opportunity cost in this scenario is $80$ because it's the benefit of the best foregone option.
* It's a microeconomic theory.
* It's a [decision mental model](https://github.com/arantespp/arantespp.com/tree/b6972d031c3b14786c74e4cbe8941b4cc5f36c0f/zettelkasten/decision-mental-models/README.md) because it helps you decide to choose among options.
* It's not easy to calculate the exact cost of all options because some are unseen because of the implicit costs.
  * Implicit costs: these costs are hidden to the naked eye and aren't made known. They're not a direct cost to you. For instance, if you have a vacation home, the implicit cost is the rental income you could have generated if you leased it.
    * Implicit costs have significant potential. If you choose to start a company instead of earning a known salary, you can make much more than the salary.
  * Explicit costs: they're direct costs of an action, executed either through a cash transaction or a physical transfer of resources.
