## Notes

- Opportunity cost is the loss of the benefit that could have been enjoyed if you've chosen the best option instead.

  - You have choices A and B, with $G_a$ and $G_b$ as their respective gain. Suppose that A is the best choice and its gain $G_a$ is $100$, whereas B was the chosen option with the gain $G_b$, $80$. The opportunity of this scenario is $G_a - G_b = 20$.

- It's calculated by $\text{Opportunity Cost} = FO_{(\text{foregone option})} - CO_{(\text{chosen option})}$.

- It's a microeconomic theory.

- It's a [decision mental model](/zettelkasten/decision-mental-models) because it helps you decide to choose among options.

- It's not easy to calculate the exact cost of all options because some are unseen because of the implicit costs.

  - Implicit costs: these costs are hidden to the naked eye and aren't made known. They're not a direct cost to you. For instance, if you have a vacation home, the implicit cost is the rental income you could have generated if you leased it.
    - Implicit costs have significant potential. If you choose to start a company instead of earning a known salary, you can make much more than the salary.
  - Explicit costs: they're direct costs of an action, executed either through a cash transaction or a physical transfer of resources.
