# Notes

* Startups created in [Venture Buildings \(VB\)](https://github.com/arantespp/arantespp.com/tree/b6972d031c3b14786c74e4cbe8941b4cc5f36c0f/zettelkasten/startup-studio/README.md) may have some problems.
  1. Startups don't have the entrepreneur who "owns" the problem. This case happens when the VB realizes a problem and search for a person to solve that problem.
  2. VB takes too much startup equity.
  3. Startups become dependant on the VB intern services and teams, they couldn't create their team after leaving VB.
