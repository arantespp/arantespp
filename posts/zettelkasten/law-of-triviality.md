# law-of-triviality

## Notes

* People within an organization commonly give disproportionate weight to trivial issues.
  * If they need to discuss a database architecture \(more important\) and the color of a button \(less important\), they'll spend more time discussing the button.
  * This happens because the more important topic the more complex it may be, and the group assumes that the ones who'll work on it understand it.
    * An average person cannot understand it, the majority of the group.
  * The less important topic may be less complex, everyone has an opinion and want to add a personal contribution.
    * **Can result in endless discussion.**
      * Now imagine this scenario and add a lot of bureaucracy and formalisms, like a parliamentary session.
* Also known as:
  * bicycle-shed effect;
  * bike-shed effect;
  * bike-shedding.
* It's a corollary of the [Parkinson's Law](https://github.com/arantespp/arantespp.com/tree/b6972d031c3b14786c74e4cbe8941b4cc5f36c0f/zettelkasten/parkinsons-law/README.md).
