# ideas-in-open-loop

## Notes

* When you decide to do some task, obligation, or plan without executing it, the mind creates an open loop.
* Open loop is something that needs to be done but hasn't yet been fulfilled.
  * You didn't think about it. You haven't clarified the intended outcome, the very next physical action step, and/or put reminders of the outcome and action required in a system you trust.
* From time to time, your mind will remember that task, even if you can't execute it at that moment.
* A lot of open loops require a lot of mental energy because they stole your attention.
* When you close an open loop, you free your mind.
* It can be large tasks such as planning a trip down to smaller tasks such as make the bed.
