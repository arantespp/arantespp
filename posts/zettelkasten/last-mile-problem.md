## Notes

* The last thing to be done to something works/arrives/finishes.
* It's the most inefficient part of the delivery.
* On the telecommunication field, the last mile problem appears when the signal cannot reach more distant places.
  * An optical fiber ring may exist in the dense part of a city but doesn't react edges of the city.
  * Cable branches must be installed so that the signal arrives in the edge.
* On logistics, the products easily arrive in metropolitan distribution centers, but it's more difficult to reach far or more inaccessible places.
  * These places may be small cities or rural areas.
  * Maybe there isn't good infrastructure to connect these places to the distribution centers, i.e. there is a river between them and need a ship to deliver the goods.
