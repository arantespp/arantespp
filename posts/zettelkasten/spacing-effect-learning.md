## Notes

* It shows that more information is retained in your [long-term memory](https://github.com/arantespp/arantespp.com/tree/b6972d031c3b14786c74e4cbe8941b4cc5f36c0f/zettelkasten/long-term-memory/README.md) by multiple spaced-out study sessions.
* It was first identified by the German psychologist [Hermann Ebbinghaus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Ebbinghaus) in 1885.
  * He says that even when we've forgotten some information, a certain quantity is stored in your subconscious mind. They cannot be consciously retrieved, but they make the process of relearning more effective.
* To activate this effect, you have to revise concepts of any subject you're studying in spaced-out study sessions.
  * Flashcards are commonly used.
* It can be used to learn anything of any field.
