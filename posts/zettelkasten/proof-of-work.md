# proof-of-work

## Notes

* Is a form of cryptography zero-knowledge proof that one part, the prover, proves to others, the verifies, that some amount of computational resources was used to complete some task.
* It was invented by [Cynthia Dwork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynthia_Dwork) and [Moni Namor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moni_Naor) in 1993 as an effort to deter denial-of-service attacks and other services abuses such as spam.
  * It costs some effort to the attacker to make a request. Thus, it becomes inviable to send a big amount of requests in a short period.
* It's asymmetric:
  * It must be hard enough to provers finish the work.
  * It must be easy to verify validate the provers result.
* It was popularized by [Bitcoin](https://github.com/arantespp/arantespp.com/tree/b6972d031c3b14786c74e4cbe8941b4cc5f36c0f/zettelkasten/bitcoin/README.md).
  * Miners spend some computational resources to append blocks on [blockchain](https://github.com/arantespp/arantespp.com/tree/b6972d031c3b14786c74e4cbe8941b4cc5f36c0f/zettelkasten/blockchain/README.md).

## Questions

* It is a cryptography zero-knowledge. May we compare this as the gold miners, in which they need mostly physical force to find gold?
* What is the difference between [CAPTCHA](https://github.com/arantespp/arantespp.com/tree/b6972d031c3b14786c74e4cbe8941b4cc5f36c0f/zettelkasten/CAPTCHA/README.md) and proof of work?
