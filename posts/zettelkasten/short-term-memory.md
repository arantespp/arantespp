# short-term-memory

## Notes

* Short-term memory can keep information for somewhere on the order of 10 seconds up to 30 seconds, when the information is not being actively rehearsed.
* It has a limited capacity: we can remember $7 \pm 2$ things before them vanish.
  * We can use the [chunking method](https://github.com/arantespp/arantespp.com/tree/b6972d031c3b14786c74e4cbe8941b4cc5f36c0f/zettelkasten/chunking-and-memory/README.md) to remember more things.
* If you want to remember a information beyond a few seconds, it may get stored in your [long-term memory](https://github.com/arantespp/arantespp.com/tree/b6972d031c3b14786c74e4cbe8941b4cc5f36c0f/zettelkasten/long-term-memory/README.md).
* It mostly encode memory acoustically, but also retain visuospatial images.
