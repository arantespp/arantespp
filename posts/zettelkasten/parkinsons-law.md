## Notes

- It stands that "work expands to fill the time available for its completion".
- Currently, it's referred to by a mathematical equation describing the rate at which bureaucracies expand over time.
- Correlated to the growth of bureaucracy in an organization or committee.
  1. Officials want to multiply subordinates, not rivals.
  2. Officials make work for each other. ðŸ¤¦
     - **Just imagine how this is inefficient and unsustainable.**
- Corollaries:
  - _"Work complicates to fill the available time."_
  - _"If you wait until the last minute, it only takes a minute to do."_
  - _"Data expands to fill the space available for storage."_
    - **Is there a kind of "energy" concept here whose principle is the same as the potential energy that makes a fluid fills the area?** I mean, if we drop a viscous fluid on the floor, it'll expand until the elements that were on top remain at the same level as the bottom elements.
      - The system had some gravitational potential energy of the top elements and this energy was reduced to a minimum.
