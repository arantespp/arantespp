## Notes

### Chapter 1 - How to Turn Time into Money

The main idea is evaluating how much your work hour is worth, that he calls **base earning target** - $BET$. It uses your year base earning target, how many days you work in a year and your productivity rate. If you earn \$200,000.00 and work 220 days in a year, 8 hours per day and have a productivity rate of 33\%, your $BET$ is calculated by:

$$
BET = \cfrac{\$200000}{220 \times \underbrace{8 \times 33\%}_{\text{productive hours}}} = \$340.92
$$

A productivity number of 33% is a very generous number for almost everyone. The other 66% of the time you spend commuting, social medias, callings, meetings, distractions in the device in our hand, etc.

Three ways of how to use this numbers:

1. It has to be in your mind constantly. You need to be hyper-conscious of the disappearance of time by minutes or hours and the money value that are disappearing too.

2. It puts a meter on other's consumption of your time. Was that call of 20 minutes worth of \$113.54? And that 10 minutes on Facebook or Twitter? It also gives to you a _"investor-think"_ mindset. _"Would I, as a venture, invest \$13,636.80 in that project, activity, person, meetings, etc that will consume 40 hours in total?"_

3. It sets the base cost for hours given to a speaking, engagement, consulting assignment, copywriting assignment and other works.

You can also estimate how much money you spent by commuting instead working at home.

In a business perspective, two business life changes that this number may come to mind:

1. You realize that you have to surround yourself with people who understand and respect the value of your time.

2. You have to eliminate tasks that aren't worth of your time.

**It helps you to decide what you shouldn't be doing. This is as important as deciding what to invest your time in.**

### Chapter 2 - How to Cheat Time

This chapter shows some ways to you multiply your time leveraging other people.

Author said that there are ways to reduce $BET$. _Why is it good to reduce this number?_

There are only three ways to make money:

1. your own work;
1. commission on other people's work;
1. money making money for you.

Three less obvious ways to leverage other people. The more you become adept at these methods, the less direct time and capital investment is required to grow your business.

- **OPM - Other People's Money**: sometimes it's more efficient use debt or investor's capital to buy growth or expansion.

- **OPR - Other's People Resources**: co-opt with other people's resources. Before you create or manage any resource with your time, you should ask yourself who is doing the same work and how you might use their work. SaaS constitute ORP - you don't need to invest time in building the platform, you can use the existing ones.

- **OPC - Other's People Customers**: _"almost without exception, the most expensive, difficult, and time-consuming aspect of a business is acquiring needed new customers, one by one, by your own advertising, marketing and selling"_. You should find ways to access OPCs, even automating it, to put in your business.

### Chapter 3 - How to Drive a Stake Through the Hearts of the Time Vampires Out to Suck You Dry

This chapter talks about _Time Vampires_, that are people who take your time and energy during all day. Dan defines some _Time Vampires_:

1. **Mr. Have-You-Got-a-Minute**: they're always asking for "have you got a minute?" or "I just need a couple of minutes of your time?", for every random thought and questions that passes to their mind (these requests take away your productivity because the inefficiency of the [human multitasking](/zettelkasten/human-multitasking)). **Solution**: discipline yourself and your team to organize the questions and communicate everything at once - not one thing at a time.

1. **Mr. Meeting**: they seen to do nothing but attend meetings. **Solution**: "you need to stop and always ask yourself: do I really need to be in - or hold - this meeting? Is there a more time-efficient way to handle this? A conference call? A memo circulated to each person?"

1. **Mr. Trivia**: they can't or doesn't want to differentiate what is important or not. They will interrupt you about anything, getting you to set aside your list of priorities in favor of his, that could be of the minimal importance. **Solution**: just ask "I'm only dealing with 9s and 10s on a 1 to 10 scale. Everything else MUST wait until tomorrow. Are you convinced that what you want to talk to me about is 9 or 10?"

1. **Soap Opera Time**: they turn everything in a emotional crisis. They react to everything emotionally. They'll try to put you in their drama. The problem is they make you give up your time to put them back together emotionally. **Solutions**: 1) cut to the core of their problem and tell them what to do, probably this is not what they want. 2) Take over the conversation by launching into a long, boring and pointless story. Turn into a vampire yourself ðŸ˜‚

Are there different varieties of Time Vampires? Yes. You must always be alert to notice any Time Vampire in your life.

### Chapter 4 - Stopping "Productivus Interruptus" Once and for All

Interruptions destroy productivity, and almost none of them have to do with necessity. In this chapter, the author shows five ways minimize these interruptions.

#### Get lost

_"If they can't find you, they can't interrupt you."_

Be inaccessible to your coworkers. Working at home is possible solution. Dan says that when he was inaccessible, their people functioned just as well or better when he was there. They handled 80% of everything on their own, and the other 20% they asked quickly and efficiently.

If you have to work in a office with the rest of our staff, it's very important that you have a **Closed Door Policy**.

#### Don't answer the phone

It's the productivity enemy number one. We have the culture to answer immediately every message, every phone call, but it doesn't have to be like this. Dan proposes a new philosophy: _"you have absolutely no legal, moral, or other responsibility to answer the phone or take a call unless you want to"_. If you're stopping your work on a task with a known priority in favor of something else with unknown priority, then you're turning the control of your day to the unknown.

#### Get a grip on email, texts, and faxes

Instant communication creates an aura of immediacy among us. People have an expectation of immediate or at least quick response from you.

The easier the mean of communication is, the more the quantity of junk messages. Which is easier, sending "we make a delicious cake" via texting or email? Or cellphone? Or fax? We can compare this with the [proof-of-work](/zettelkasten/proof-of-work) method, that creates some cost to the sender but no or low cost to the receiver - the sender will only pay the cost if the request or message is more important than the cost.

The author uses only fax. He compared the quality of the messages he receives with the messages of his clients that use email. His received messages are much more objective and organized.

Wherever the communicating mean you use, you have to setup boundaries of the frequency and the screen time you allow yourself to check them. Also, you have to make them clear to your clients and coworkers.

#### Set the timer on the bomb

Whenever you have to take an incoming call or meet someone, it's a smart idea to set up an exit time.

> _I have a conference call starting in just 15 minutes, but I wanted to take your call - I hope that will be enough time for our discussion. Do you agree or should we setup another telephone appointment?_

#### Be busy and be obvious about it

If you're sitting at your desk, appearing relaxed, to the others, you're it, even if you're disarming a nuclear bomb. When you're visible to others, it's best to be visibly busy.

### Chapter 5 - The Number-One Most Powerful Personal Discipline in All the World: And How It Can Make You Successful Beyond Your Wildest Dreams

This chapter is about punctuality. Dan starts the chapter stating that **everybody** he's met who adheres to this discipline becomes exceptionally successful, and everybody who ignores, fails. Some arguments to be punctual.

- It gives to you the right to expect and demand that others respect your time. You can't expect others respect your time if you show no respect for theirs.

- A person who cannot keep appointments on time or cannot keep scheduled commitments, cannot be trusted in other ways either.

- People judges you by your punctuality. Most successful people make a point of having "instant reject criteria" to save their time in determining who they want to deal with - punctuality is one of these criteria.

- It's correlated to self-esteem. Someone that doesn't keep scheduled appointment is not only saying that you and your time are unimportant but is also revealing that he/she and his/time are important either - low self-esteem characteristic.

- It's correlated to needy egos. They're always late as a means of trying to be and seen important. Their intended message is: _"I can be late because I'm more important than you"_.

### Chapter 6 - The Magic Power That Makes You Unstoppable

This chapter talks about discipline and habits. As usual, it starts stating that you may achieve success if you have self-discipline. Beyond what everyone says, Dan talks about how demonstrated self-discipline is **magnetic**. If you demonstrate that you have self-discipline (the same to self-esteem and self-control), your clients will have an unconscious preference on you, to give their money to you.

Very successful people are secretly lazy and become exceptionally self-disciplined out of necessity. Because some of them are their own boss, they can spend their time as please and because of this it's very important to be self-disciplined.

Three steps to consistent successful achievement: **awareness**, **decision** and **action**.

### Chapter 7 - The Ten Time Management Techniques Really Worth Using

Ten time management techniques really worth using.

#### 1. Tame All the Interruptions

[Chapter 4](#chapter-4-stopping-productivus-interruptus-once-and-for-all).

#### 2. Minimize Meetings

Most meetings end where they being. Find strategies to abbreviate and focus them.

#### 3. Practice Absolute Punctuality

[Chapter 5](#chapter-5-the-number-one-most-powerful-personal-discipline-in-all-the-world-and-how-it-can-make-you-successful-beyond-your-wildest-dreams).

#### 4. Make and Use Lists

Dan uses four basic lists:

1. **My Schedule**: for entire year, day by day.

1. **Things to Do List**: is organized by the month, the week, and each day prioritized as A's, B's and C's.

1. **People to Call List**.

1. **Conference Planner**: a page for each person the author interacts a lot, where he jots down things he needs to talk to them about as they occur to him between meetings or conversations.

The "magic" here is more in the making and using lists than in particular tool, medium, or format you use.

> If you aren't making lists, you probably aren't making a lot of money.

#### 5. Fight to Link Everything to Your Goals

A secret to be more productive is to have more reasons to be productive. When you have your goals clearly in your mind, you'll have a good reason to be more productive. A definition of productivity:

> Productivity is the deliberate, strategic investment of your time, talent, intelligence, energy, resources, and opportunities in a manner calculated to move you measurably closes to meaningful goals.

By definition, productivity presupposes the existence of _meaningful goals_. You also have to find a way to measure them. Always ask to yourself:

> Is what I'm doing, this minute, moving me measurably closes to my goals?

The simply fact you measure your goals improve productivity. Just asking the question will enhance your productivity. Of course you need time for casual conversations, reading comics, and other activities that aren't correlated to your goals. But you should to do those things consciously and by choice.

#### 6. Tickle the Memory with Tickler Files

This technique reduce clutter and serve as automattic memory. You have 90 file folders, red, blue and white, all of them numbered 1 thought 30. Red, blue and white represent the current month, next month, and the month after that. If you assume meet a client on tenth next month, you drop his file into the blue file folder numbered 10.

#### 7. Block Your Time

Make inviolate appointments with yourself as you have yours locked-in-stone appointments with others. You have to find when your body and mind perform the tasks more effectively and assign that time for you. Also, throw out all norms, "rules", others' opinions and create the best work conditions for yourself that facilitate your best productivity.

#### 8. Minimize Unplanned Activity

This technique is very interesting. An unplanned activity means that it doesn't have start and end time, so it may never finish. As stated by [Parkinson's Law](/zettelkasten/parkinsons-law):

> Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.

But for you minimize unplanned activities, you have to put some pressure on you. Isn't it bad, it is? Pressure is good, stress, don't. Pressure helps you achieve better results than without it. Your days become more organized. Steve Jobs and Walt Disney were both notorious for placing "impossible" deadlines on projects.

Without pressure, your tasks, routine and schedule become chaotic and disorganized. You will be juggling priorities, randomly responding to interruptions and letting work expand its consumption of time as it sees fit. This scenario causes a lot of pressure and stress.

> There is a false idea that "creative people" work liberated from deadlines and time pressure and need the freedom to wait for inspiration. Not the successful ones. Not the productive ones.

You can also use the value of a project to estimate how much time you allow yourself to dedicate to it. The number is the value of how much the project worth in total income divided by your [$BET$](#chapter-1-how-to-turn-time-into-money).

#### 9. Profit from "Odd-Lot" Time

Use your free time waiting in a airport, stuck in a traffic, or parked in a reception in a effective way. Whenever you get in this situation, take it to listen to audios, read a book or any productive purpose, but not the ones that require properly preparation.

#### 10. Live off Peak

Avoid peaks.

- Don't go to the bank at the same time everyone goes.
- Don't travel at the same time everyone travels.

### Chapter 8 - Decisiveness

Learn to make decision quickly. **Decisiveness saves a lot of time**.

In business proposals, Dan says that almost everybody in his field has a least a three-step client-conversation process:

1. The initial fact-finding and diagnostic meeting.
2. Developing and presenting a detailed proposal.
3. The last meeting to close the sale.

He closes his sales in one fell swoop in 90% of the cases once he stopped proposing and began prescribing. "Don't do proposals. Do action plans", Nido Qubein said.

### Chapter 9 - Fire Yourself, Replace Yourself, Make More Money, and Have More Fun

You must divest yourself of those activities you don't do well and don't do happily, or you must find a routine, so as to systematically invest your time in those things you do extraordinarily well and find intellectual stimulating ([flow state](/zettelkasten/flow-state-psychology)).

Steps to achieve that:

#### Step One: Honest Self-Analysis and Self-Understanding

The typical entrepreneurs know that they can do anything and everything because, at some point in time, he has to. However, only few things they do extraordinary well, in a such way they wouldn't hire anybody else to do them.

You should create three lists of things you do:

1. extraordinary well.
1. well, better than most, but cannot be considered your "specialties".
1. not very well, but do anyway.

#### Step Two: Delegation

["Delegate or Stagnate."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrrgyQa25DQ). The only way to advance in any business is to keep delegating. You must keep in mind there's more than one way to be right, so when you delegate, you should accept that the other person may complete the task in a different way than yours. Also, that good enough is good enough. Sometimes people won't do tasks as perfectly as you would, but will wind up with the same result, and this is good enough.

Mastering Delegation:

1. Define what is to be done.
2. Be certain the delegate understands what is to be done - never assuming you've successfully communicated.
3. Explain why it is to be done as you prescribing it to be done. Should be a room for differences of opinions about the execution and you should encourage it.
4. Establish what defines a successful outcome.
5. Set a deadline for completion or progress report (see [Chapter 8](#chapter-8-decisiveness)).
6. Follow-up. Act if the person and delegated task don't return to you at the agreed-on date and time.

#### Step Three: Replacing Yourself

Fire yourself from those tasks that aren't your specialty. Generally, marketing is the most difficult task to hire someone. Effectively market and promote the business should be the task that the entrepreneur should focus.

#### Step Four: Welcoming Your Dispensability

> The ultimate entrepreneurial achievement is complete replacement of self with the business thriving in new hands and your wealth secured or income continuing or even growing.

#### What to Do with the Time You Liberate

**Enjoy the success you create.** But, if you're looking for more money and wealth, then turn your attention to marketing. Marketing is the highest-paid profession and most valuable part of a business.
