## Notes

### Chapter 1 - How to Turn Time into Money

The main idea is evaluating how much your work hour is worth, that he calls **base earning target** - $BET$. It uses your year base earning target, how many days you work in a year and your productivity rate. If you earn \$200,000.00 and work 220 days in a year, 8 hours per day and have a productivity rate of 33\%, your $BET$ is calculated by:

$$
BET = \cfrac{\$200000}{220 \times \underbrace{8 \times 33\%}_{\text{productive hours}}} = \$340.92
$$

A productivity number of 33% is a very generous number for almost everyone. The other 66% of the time you spend commuting, social medias, callings, meetings, distractions in the device in our hand, etc.

Three ways of how to use this numbers:

1. It has to be in your mind constantly. You need to be hyper-conscious of the disappearance of time by minutes or hours and the money value that are disappearing too.

2. It puts a meter on other's consumption of your time. Was that call of 20 minutes worth of \$113.54? And that 10 minutes on Facebook or Twitter? It also gives to you a _"investor-think"_ mindset. _"Would I, as a venture, invest \$13,636.80 in that project, activity, person, meetings, etc that will consume 40 hours in total?"_

3. It sets the base cost for hours given to a speaking, engagement, consulting assignment, copywriting assignment and other works.

You can also estimate how much money you spent by commuting instead working at home.

In a business perspective, two business life changes that this number may come to mind:

1. You realize that you have to surround yourself with people who understand and respect the value of your time.

2. You have to eliminate tasks that aren't worth of your time.

**It helps you to decide what you shouldn't be doing. This is as important as deciding what to invest your time in.**

### Chapter 2 - How to Cheat Time

This chapter show some ways to you multiply your time leveraging other people.

Author said that there are ways to reduce $BET$. _Why is it good to reduce this number?_

There are only three ways to make money:

1. your own work;
1. commission on other people's work;
1. money making money for you.

Three less obvious ways to leverage other people. The more you become adept at these methods, the less direct time and capital investment is required to grow your business.

- **OPM - Other People's Money**: sometimes it's more efficient use debt or investor's capital to buy growth or expansion.

- **OPR - Other's People Resources**: co-opt with other people's resources. Before you create or manage any resource with your time, you should ask yourself who is doing the same work and how you might use their work. SaaS constitute ORP - you don't need to invest time in building the platform, you can use the existing ones.

- **OPC - Other's People Customers**: _"almost without exception, the most expensive, difficult, and time-consuming aspect of a business is acquiring needed new customers, one by one, by your own advertising, marketing and selling"_. You should find ways to access OPCs, even automating it, to put in your business.
