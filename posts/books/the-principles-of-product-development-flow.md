title: The Principles of Product Development Flow
excerpt: 'The Principles of Product Development Flow will forever change the way you think about product development. Reinertsen starts with the ideas of lean manufacturing but goes far beyond them, drawing upon ideas from telecommunications networks, transportation systems, computer operating systems and military doctrine. He combines a lucid explanation of the science behind flow with a rich set of practical approaches. This is another landmark book by one of the foremost experts on product development.'

## Principles

### The Economic View

#### E1: The Principle of Quantified Overall Economics: Select actions based on quantified overall economic impact.

You should consider the economic impact of all possible decisions when you have to make a project decision. Choosing between releasing a project soon without many tests or testing more and release later should be an economic, not a philosophical choice.

#### E2. The Principle of Interconnected Variables: We can't just change one thing.

One decision almost always simultaneously affects multiple variables. [Proxy variables](/zettelkasten/proxy-variable) are interconnected because they represent other variables.

#### E3. The Principle of Quantified Cost of Delay If you only quantify one thing, quantify the cost of delay.

We don't have business trading money for cicly time if we don't know the economic value of cycle time. No single sensitivity is more eye-opening the cost of delay (COD). The economics of flow is dominated by the cost of queues, that need COD to be determined.

#### E4. The Principle of Economic Value-Added: The value added by an activity is the change in the econimic value of the work product.

The value added by an activity is the difference in the price that an economically rational buyer would pay for a work before, and after, the activity performed.

Waste, or non-value-added, is also an economic concept. We must convert waste in life-cycle profit to compare and trade-off different wastes.

### Controlling Flow Under Uncertainty

#### F8: The Cadence Batch Size Enabling Principle: Use a regular cadence to enable small batch sizes.

Cadence enforces small batch size by forcing work products to move forward on a fixed rhythm. For example, if the review is every X time, the batch size is X time worth of work.

It also enforces small batch sizes because it removes coordination overhead, the transaction cost. Everyone knows that the event will occur on some date, so there is no overhead associated with setting up the event. With the lower transaction cost, small batches are economical.
