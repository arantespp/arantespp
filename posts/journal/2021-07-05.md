- I create some tests for hooks using [react-hooks-testing-library](https://github.com/testing-library/react-hooks-testing-library).

- We decided about the 4 products that we're going to focus on Tri√¢ngulos.

  1.  Startups.
  1.  Web Applications.
  1.  Landing pages.
  1.  WhatsApp integrations.

- I schedule a call to talk about an opportunity to be CTO of a medical startup.

- I studied MongoDB and published [this article](https://dev.to/arantespp/mongodb-shell-commands-running-on-docker-101-1l73) about its shell commands.

- I need to provide a cloud architecture to handle an application with MongoDB, Java API, and Angular client.
