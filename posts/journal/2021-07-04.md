- I rested a lot this Sunday.

- I worked on the edition feature of my blog because Grammarly can make recommendations directly on the post's page.

- I slept two hours at the end of the afternoon because I was starting to being sick. I woke up better.

- I considered writing about roles at the technology department of Tri√¢ngulos.

- At night, I studied [Principles E11 and E12 of Flow](/books/the-principles-of-product-development-flow#e11-the-subdivision-principle-inside-every-bad-choice-lies-a-good-choice).
