- I woke up at 6:00.

- I started to read Getting Things Done chapter 4.

- I went to talk to Bruno in the Backstage agency. I'm considering taking their offer because I'll learn a lot about posture and aplomb.

  - Fernanda told me I'm insecure. She's right. It was impressive how she noticed that in me just by observing me. **How can I overcome this?**

- We had our mentorship today. We always should seek cash in hand and money flow.

- Ennio and I worked on a proposal to set up email to our clients at night.

- I, regrettably, opened YouTube and spend some time there by default. I have to pay attention to don't let YouTube and social media consume my time.
