- I talked with M. He wanted to add a Plan B to his life, then he decided to study more about web development. I recommended he could study Next.js to create a personal website for him.

- I read the first two chapters of [Getting Things Done](/books/getting-things-done) to implement the techniques to organize my tasks.
