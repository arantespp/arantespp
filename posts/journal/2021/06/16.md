- I woke up at 5:30 a.m., but I stayed in bed until 6:00 because I was sleepy.

- I did my 30 minutes meditation and started my day.

- I couldn't keep the schedule as intended. I had to ask for food today, and it arrives at 13:00. Also, I had a call on the interval of 13:00 to 14:00.

- I read about cadence in [The Principles of Product Development Flow](/zettelkasten/the-principles-o-product-development-flow) book.
