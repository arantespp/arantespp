- I was in São Carlos, at my friend's home.

- I woke up at 7 a.m. and meditated for 30 minutes. Thirty minutes of meditation is becoming more natural for me.

- I lost the bus that departs from São Carlos to Campinas at 12:50 p.m. I waited until 3:10 p.m in USP. I had a nostalgic and sad feeling seeing the university empty because of the pandemic.

- I traveled all day. I arrived at my mother's house at 7 p.m. I tried to work a little, but I couldn't focus so much.

- I was feeling very lonely at the end of the day.

- I decided to test [Benjamin Franklin's schedule](/zettelkasten/benjamin-franklin-s-schedule) for one month.

- I went to bed at 10 p.m.
