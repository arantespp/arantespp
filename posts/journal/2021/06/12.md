- I started to write the article [A Letter to My Friend - Create](/articles/a-letter-to-my-friend-create) to respond to a friend's message.

- I went to São Carlos to see my partners.

- The bus departure schedule was 12:50, but it only departed at 14:30 because there was a President's march in São Paulo. As a result, I lost the appointment I had in a barbershop.

- It was a fun night with my partners, but I couldn't stay awake like them, then I went to sleep at 2:30.
