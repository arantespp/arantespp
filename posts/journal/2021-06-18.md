- I woke up without an alarm at 4:40, and I was sleepy all day.

- Before meetings, I studied to ask these questions:

  - Which characteristics must a good company have?
  - What are the minimum requirements to build an MVP?

- I started writing an article about the questions above.

- I had meetings all day with my partners. We tried to:

  - reach a consensus about what is an MVP;
  - difference between MVP and prototype;
  - what filters should we use to confirm if an idea is a good business idea.

- I continued my Instagram posts generator project at night.

- I went to bed at 23:00.
