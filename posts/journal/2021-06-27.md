- It was an atypical Sunday. I read and watched videos about eigenvalues and eigenvectors because I saw an article about [eigenquestions](https://coda.io/@shishir/eigenquestions-the-art-of-framing-problems).

- I received the news that a partner of a project passed away from Covid. I'm sorry. I hope your family has a lot of strength in this period.

- In the afternoon, I went to Taquaral Park to walk and talk a little bit with L. It was a great time.

- I went to bed at 22:00. I thought about L. before sleeping. I hope she is okay.
