- As I decided to apply Benjamin Franklin's schedule for a month yesterday, I started it today.

- I woke up at 5:30 a.m., but I'll wake up at 5:00 a.m. in the following days.

- I did my 30 minutes meditation, had breakfast, and researched Benjamin Franklin's schedule during the 5 to 7 a.m. My answer to the "What good shall I do this day?" was "At least, start Benjamin Franklin's schedule."

- My two blocks of work weren't so much productive. I was tired and couldn't have much focus.

- I had lunch and read Awaken the Giant Within, by Tony Robbins, from 12 to 1 p.m. I read the first chapter. I liked how the author proposed the book because it'll work with the emotional, physical, social, financial, and time big fields.

- At the final of the second work block, I begin to read the chapter Controlling Flow Under Uncertainty of the book [The Principles of Product Development Flow](/books/the-principles-o-product-development-flow)
