- I started to writing the article My Story - Then I Met Sibelius Seraphini.

- I added some unit tests in this blog. [Law of Triviality](/zettelkasten/law-of-triviality) took me because I spend some time in the morning creating tests than writing the article.

- I studied Angular, Java, and MongoDB to serve a POC we're going to test.

- I didn't spend much time on cellphone today.

- At night, I read [E3 and E4 Flow principles](/books/the-principles-of-product-development-flow#e3-the-principle-of-quantified-cost-of-delay-if-you-only-quantify-one-thing-quantify-the-cost-of-delay) and I improved some notes grammar.
