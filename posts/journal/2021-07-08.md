- I took Janssen Covid-19 vaccine.

- I posted on Instagram that I took the vaccine, and a friend, B. that I haven't talked to for years, messaged me because of my Instagram story. We had a delightful and nostalgic talking. We changed messages all day because we had a lot of things to say about our last years.

  - Talking to her was so natural.

- We had a meeting applying the [LDJ](/zettelkasten/lightning-decision-jam) to our project WDE (old Etvrg).

- I had the PMO Sync meeting.

- I felt nothing because of the vaccine, just my arm that had a little pain.
