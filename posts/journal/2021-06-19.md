- I woke up late, at 7:00.

- I continued my Instagram posts generator project until the middle of the afternoon. I completed about 80%.

- I felt very lonely. It's like an infinite loop: I feel lonely, I try to talk with people (virtually because pandemic and I'm in Campinas), they don't answer as I expect, I feel more alone.

  - I need to change my mind about needing others to overcome my solitude. I need to learn how to overcome loneliness by myself.

- I did my 1-hour meditation. I focused and tried to find answers to my loneliness.

- At night, I worked in an e-commerce setup for Carlos.

- **I talked with a friend that went to a square to read a book alone. Do this kind of activity is powerful. She doesn't need anyone to do things.**

- I talked with another friend about cheap dopamine and how social media induce this. Instagram, for instance, may arouse the sexual desires of some people because there are many sexy pictures there. My friend doesn't feel safe opening her Instagram profile because she doesn't know what these people might do with her photos.

  - We also talked about infinite talks. They're talks that never end, and they're natural to begin. That is why I never like an Instagram message because it's like the conversation is over.

- I went to bed at 23:45.
